**Dear Reader,**

Welcome to DOCSAID's GitHub homepage.

I'm an AI engineer living in Taiwan and also the founder of this organization, Zephyr.

The reason behind establishing this organization is quite straightforward. It offers more enriched features than a personal account does, allowing me to invite like-minded friends to code together and explore interesting topics. Using a GitHub organization account brings more fascinating features without any additional cost (right?).

With so many advantages, why not create one for fun? Exactly my thought!

However, the most challenging part of this whole endeavor has been creating a logo for the organization. It's indeed a troublesome task. As an AI engineer, using Paint is already my limit. Although I've tried asking GPT to help me draw, it always ended up creating something bizarre. Eventually, after a bit of chaos, it turned into what you see now, and I hope you don't find it too strange.

**DOCSAID** is a name composed of two words: "DOC" and "SAID". Since my work primarily revolves around text analysis, I wanted the organization's name to reflect this field. Essentially, it means:

<div align="center">

**The moment a document is created, it has already said what it wants to convey.**

</div>

So, what exactly did these documents say? Now, we just need to analyze them!

Interestingly, after finalizing the name, I realized it even contains the letters AI, which was a pleasant surprise.

Analyzing documents is my daily job, including image text recognition, image fraud detection, topic classification, keyword extraction, and more. In my view, a document isn't just words; it could be an image, a video, a song, a dataset, or even a person's behavior. As long as there's analytical value or we're willing to analyze it, I believe everything can be considered a documents! (chaotic evil?)

So, how many people are in this organization?

Strictly speaking: None.

So far, I haven't formed any official partnerships; it's more like a diary etched with code.

But from a broader perspective, I do get some help from my friends who brainstorm ideas or write some code. In that sense, there are two or three free members. Maybe at some suitable moment in the future, they might decide to join or become co-founders to establish a larger organization, but that's for the future to decide.

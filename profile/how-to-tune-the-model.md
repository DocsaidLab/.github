### If you want to adjust the model?

This might be your most concerning topic.

Based on the topics I've defined and the models I provide, I believe we can solve most application scenarios. However, I also understand that some scenarios might require better model performance, necessitating the collection of your own dataset for model fine-tuning.

You might get stuck at this step, like most people do, but don't panic.

I've broadly categorized this issue into three plus one scenarios:

- **Scenario One: You know exactly what I'm doing:**

    In this case, you can directly fork my project and use your own dataset for model training. This way, you can achieve better model performance. If you encounter any issues during this process, feel free to raise them, and I'd be more than willing to resolve them.

- **Scenario Two: You know my project's functionality meets your needs, but you don't know how to adjust it:**

    In this scenario, you can directly send me an email with your requirements and the "dataset you want to solve". I can help you fine-tune the model, allowing you to achieve better model performance.

    It's free, but I can't be pressured for time, and I don't guarantee execution. (<== This is important!)

    Although I'm working on open-source projects, I'm not just doing this for fun. When the time comes, the model will naturally be updated, and you "might" get better model performance by just sending an email. Anyway, it can be considered a win-win situation, right?

- **Scenario Three: You want to develop a specific functionality:**

    Then, send me an email to discuss it. If I find it interesting, I'd be more than happy to help you develop it, but I hope you can prepare a dataset of a certain scale first. Even if I'm interested, I might not have the time to obtain enough data, or some special data might require special channels to acquire.

    This scenario is the same as the above; it's free, but I can't be pressured for time, and I don't guarantee execution.

    Note that the final result must be open-source, allowing more people to benefit. The ownership of the development project also fully belongs to me. Of course, I'll add you to the contributors section of the project documentation, and regardless of how I handle the project later, you'll retain the right to use it.

- **Scenario Four: When Rapid Development of a Specific Feature is Your Goal:**

    When time is of the essence, we can shift towards a commissioned development collaboration. Based on your requirements, I'll present a reasonable quote. The calculation is straightforward: the time I need to invest multiplied by my salary, plus some necessary development costs. How I manage to find people to help with the development is my concern.

    Taking the `DocAligner` project as an example, starting from scratch, according to my development pace, it normally requires a six-month development cycle. (In reality, because I was too engrossed, I completed it in just three months by working intensively), such a commissioned project would be quoted at around $25,000. This price encompasses the entire process from data collection, model training, to system deployment, just as you see.

    Additionally, you might overlook the "necessary costs" mentioned above, referring to training machines. I've worked on a facial recognition project before, where, with the dataset and machine ready, it took two months to complete a model. So, the development cost was roughly $8,000, but the cloud training machine rental fee amounted to $20,000 (a significant expense!), which is a cost that must be considered.

    Also, I won't accept proposals like: "I want to achieve XXX's LLM OOO functionality". While I am also skilled at building generative models, it's only on a small scale. Anything related to LLM often involves expenditures in the hundreds of millions. Currently, I remain a user, and as for training, I apologize for the inconvenience.

    It's important to note that even in commissioned development, the ownership of the project remains with me. I don't recommend buying out projects because it doesn't align with the principle of continuous progress. In the AI field, as technology advances, today's solutions might quickly become outdated. If you buy out a project, over time, you might find that this investment has lost its original value. But don't worry, the purpose of commissioned development is to swiftly meet your needs. If I succeed, it's a win-win outcome, and we can happily conclude the transaction. If not, consider it a lack of skill on my part, and I won't charge you any development fees, but if cloud machines are rented, that cost still needs to be covered. Although I can absorb the development costs myself, the expense of cloud machines is too high for me to bear, please understand.

    You might find the issue of project ownership perplexing.

    But give it some thought, and you might realize that you're just looking to "drink milk", not necessarily "own a cow".

    - How tiring is it to raise a cow? (You need to maintain engineers for the project)
    - It takes up space and is hard to care for. (Setting up training machines is expensive, renting cloud machines is pricey, and buying hardware often breaks)
    - It fears the cold and the heat. (Tuning models until you question your life choices)
    - And it might just die on you unexpectedly. (Failing to meet expected results)
    - Truly, it's a loss. (Spending money to buy out the project)

    If after careful consideration, you still insist on buying out the project, I won't stop you. I'll provide you with another quote, and we can still collaborate together.

- **Please Note:**
  - **In all forms of development projects, I absolutely will not open source your data unless I have your permission.**
  - **Normally, the data will only be used to update the model.**
  - **Dataset submission: docsaidlab@gmail.com**

Finally, please remember, I'm an AI engineer, not a jack-of-all-trades. So, I won't do things I'm not good at, like front-end, back-end, databases, networking, etc. If you have such needs, I can only say: I might try to find the right person for you, but it's not guaranteed. The problem I'm best at solving is, given an input, to produce a specific output, and I can try my best to solve it with a model. Just like the projects I've open-sourced.

Welcome to DOCSAID's GitHub homepage.

## What's New? 🚀

- **March 2024**

  - One day, I discovered that the file download feature on Google Drive was broken. What was supposed to be data retrieved through [`gen_download_cmd`](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit/blob/f281acd3f7f688fa7a71b70d92c6d3ef0ea2f5ca/docsaidkit/utils/utils.py#L66) turned into "a bunch of error html". 👻 👻 👻
  - After some consideration, I decided to use the open-source framework [**NextCloud**](https://github.com/nextcloud) to build a private cloud for data storage and updated the previously released download links.

- **February 2024**

  - **TextDetector**: Began development by collecting public data.
  - [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): Introduced CLIP to the model for knowledge distillation, which worked wonderfully!

- **January 2024**

  - **TextDetector**: Initial project planning.
  - [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): Development completed, turned into an open-source project. 🎉 🎉 🎉

- **December 2023**

  - [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): Started development.
  - [**DocAligner**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocAligner): Development completed, turned into an open-source project. 🎉 🎉 🎉
  - [**blog**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/blog): Discovered an interesting Facebook open-source project [**docusaurus**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus). It offers a simple way to create a static website that can be written in Markdown. So, I decided to use it for my blog: [docsaid.org](https://docsaid.org/).

- **November 2023**

  - [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): Initial project planning.
  - [**DocAligner**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocAligner): Started development.

  - Created this organization's GitHub account and began planning some projects.

## In Conclusion 🍹

In this era, we are fortunate to have Google, OpenAI, Meta, NVIDIA, and countless active open-source communities. From their open-source projects, we can glean a wealth of knowledge and learn cutting-edge technologies. By sharing open-source projects, I hope to pass on this joy and knowledge to many others, letting us advance together in this field.

If you like my projects, don't hesitate, just take them and use them.

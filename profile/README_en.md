Welcome to DOCSAID's GitHub homepage.

I am an AI engineer living in Taiwan, and also the founder of this organization, Zephyr.

## What's New? 🚀

- **March 2024**

  - One day, I discovered that the file download feature on Google Drive was broken. What was supposed to be data retrieved through [`gen_download_cmd`](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit/blob/f281acd3f7f688fa7a71b70d92c6d3ef0ea2f5ca/docsaidkit/utils/utils.py#L66) turned into "a bunch of error html". 👻 👻 👻
  - After some consideration, I decided to use the open-source framework [**NextCloud**](https://github.com/nextcloud) to build a private cloud for data storage and updated the previously released download links.

- **February 2024**

  - **TextDetector**: Began development by collecting public data.
  - [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): Introduced CLIP to the model for knowledge distillation, which worked wonderfully!

- **January 2024**

  - **TextDetector**: Initial project planning.
  - [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): Development completed, turned into an open-source project. 🎉 🎉 🎉

- **December 2023**

  - [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): Started development.
  - [**DocAligner**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocAligner): Development completed, turned into an open-source project. 🎉 🎉 🎉
  - [**blog**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/blog): Discovered an interesting Facebook open-source project [**docusaurus**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus). It offers a simple way to create a static website that can be written in Markdown. So, I decided to use it for my blog: [docsaid.org](https://docsaid.org/).

- **November 2023**

  - [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): Initial project planning.
  - [**DocAligner**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocAligner): Started development.
  - [**DocsaidKit**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit): Development completed, turned into an open-source project. 🎉 🎉 🎉

- **August 2023**

  - [**DocAligner**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocAligner): Initial project planning.
  - [**DocsaidKit**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit): Started developing common tools.
  - Created this organization's GitHub account and began planning some projects.

## In Conclusion 🍹

In this era, we're fortunate to have giants like Google, OpenAI, Meta, and NVIDIA, along with an active open-source community, driving the advancement of technology. Their contributions allow us to access cutting-edge knowledge and technologies, enriching our learning and development. However, as the global focus narrows on the development of large language models (LLMs), we may overlook numerous everyday problems awaiting solutions.

I believe that every small contribution is a part of our collective effort to create a better life for everyone.

If you're interested in my projects or resonate with my views, please feel free to use and share them.

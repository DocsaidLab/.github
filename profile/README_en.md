Welcome to DOCSAID's GitHub homepage.

I am an AI engineer living in Taiwan, and also the founder of this organization, Zephyr.

## What's New? 🚀

- **March 2024**

  - Completed the [**technical documentation**](https://docsaid.org/category/docsaidkit) for **DocsaidKit**.
  - **GmailSummary**: Development completed and the project has been made open source. 🎉 🎉 🎉
  - Discovered a malfunction in the file download feature of Google Drive. Data that was previously accessible through the [`gen_download_cmd`](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit/blob/f281acd3f7f688fa7a71b70d92c6d3ef0ea2f5ca/docsaidkit/utils/utils.py#L66) started returning "a bunch of erroneous html" (👻 👻 👻). After some consideration, I decided to use [**NextCloud**](https://github.com/nextcloud) to set up a private cloud for data storage and updated the previously released download links.

- **February 2024**

  - **DocClassifier**: Introduced CLIP into the model and performed knowledge distillation, which greatly improved its performance!

- **January 2024**

  - **DocClassifier**: Development completed and the project has been made open source. 🎉 🎉 🎉

- **December 2023**

  - **DocAligner**: Development completed and the project has been made open source. 🎉 🎉 🎉
  - **blog**: Discovered an interesting open-source project by Facebook called [**docusaurus**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus). It offers a simple way to create a static website, with content written in Markdown. Therefore, I decided to use it to create a blog: [**docsaid.org**](https://docsaid.org/).

- **November 2023**

  - **DocsaidKit**: Development completed and the project has been made open source. 🎉 🎉 🎉
  - **DocGenerator**: Second phase of development completed.

- **August 2023**

  - **DocGenerator**: First phase of development completed.
  - Created the organization's GitHub account and started planning several projects.

## In Conclusion 🍹

In this era, we're fortunate to have giants like Google, OpenAI, Meta, and NVIDIA, along with an active open-source community, driving the advancement of technology. Their contributions allow us to access cutting-edge knowledge and technologies, enriching our learning and development. However, as the global focus narrows on the development of large language models (LLMs), we may overlook numerous everyday problems awaiting solutions.

I believe that every small contribution is a part of our collective effort to create a better life for everyone.

If you're interested in my projects or resonate with my views, please feel free to use and share them.
